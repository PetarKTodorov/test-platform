================================================================================

    This file as the name says is for styles that must be moved to the right
    file, the purpose of this file comes in handy when you work with developers
    who do not know how to write CSS/SCSS or how to find the right place to
    change something. They just need to copy the selector from the browser and
    overwrite the properties, then the front-end developer implements it in the
    right file and way.
